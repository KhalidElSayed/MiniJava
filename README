MiniJava - the eponymous compiler.

A modified version of the project three starter is available at
src/java/. The clojure code automatically loads class files from
classes/ folder.

To build the java code and download deps:
$ ant
$ lein deps

To start a slime server:
$ lein swank

To run the tests:
$ lein test

Don't use `lein repl`.

Leiningen is available at http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/.
