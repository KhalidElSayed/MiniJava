#+TODO: TODO | INPROGRESS | DONE

* Part Three
** DONE tests for x86 frame                                            :mike:
** DONE implement (create-x86frame) & etc                              :mike:

The current implementation is tied heavily to the Java classes,
making it fairly ugly to use. Before we start depending heavily on
its internals, I want to rewrite it using deftype/defprotocol.

The InFrame/InReg types are fine, though.

** DONE basic structure of translator                                  :mike:
** TODO equality of datatypes that depend on (label)

I had to neuter the equality of any datatype that depends on (label),
otherwise we can't test them, because every (label) is unique. We
need a special binding that will let us override the initial (label).

** INPROGRESS tests for translate
** INPROGRESS fix the interpreter                                     :asumu:
** INPROGRESS implement minijava.translate.implementation
** DONE attach types to every variable                                  :sam:

When we call a method on an object, I need to be able to calculate
the address of the function at compile time, so I need its type.

** TODO BinaryOp and canon
** TODO interface from ir to canon
** Optional
*** INPROGRESS reimplement the minijava.ir.canon algorithms
