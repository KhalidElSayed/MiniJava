#+TODO: TODO | INPROGRESS | DONE

* Part Three
** TODO hook up the junit tests
** DONE tests for x86 frame                                            :mike:
** DONE implement (create-x86frame) & etc                              :mike:

The current implementation is tied heavily to the Java classes,
making it fairly ugly to use. Before we start depending heavily on
its internals, I want to rewrite it using deftype/defprotocol.

The InFrame/InReg types are fine, though.

** INPROGRESS basic structure of translator                            :mike:
** TODO equality of datatypes that depend on (label)

I had to neuter the equality of any datatype that depends on (label),
otherwise we can't test them, because every (label) is unique. We
need a special binding that will let us override the initial (label).

** TODO tests for translate
** INPROGRESS fix the interpreter                                     :asumu:
** TODO implement minijava.translate.implementation
** Optional
*** TODO reimplement the minijava.ir.canon algorithms
